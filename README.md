CLIB (C Library)
==========

About
----------
CLIB is just that - a library for C code - not C++ (though it will of course compile) the idea is to build up a ibrary of code and have some tools and applications to use these libraries.

Note from the Author
---
Makefiles are included for all libraries and projects.
Suggested compile - navigate to folder of the project to compile (libraries must be compiled based on dependancies) and run make;make clean - which will compile the libraries and executables and clean up the object files after.
All Makefiles will compile with pedantic errors turned on - therefore there will be no warnings and no errors in complete C.
